Begin by considering theoretical explorations of humor and \"Jewish humor.\" Then trace techniques of Jewish humor from eastern Europe to central Europe to North America, paying specific attention to Jewish American humor. Themes to be examined include: in-group vs. out-group humor; humor and ethnicity; performance and \"Jewface\"; Jewish-Christian difference; humor and the Holocaust; gender and ethnicity; the notion of self-hatred; American popular culture; and the relationship between humor, repetition, and innovation.

Organized around familiar animal categories - dogs, cats, horses, apes, birds, insects - we examine the representation of animals in modern literature as a way to give an account of the cultural history of human-animal relations and, in doing so, to make us reflect upon the social, political, and environmental consequences of this history at a time when animal species are disappearing at an alarming rate.\nENGL 379 — Postcolonial and World Literature\n3 credits.\nEnglish language literatures of former colonies, primarily in Africa and South Asia.

May include multi-modal assignments.\nENGL/​GEN&WS 401 — Race, Sex, and Texts (How to do things with writing)\n3 credits.\nUses writing in many forms and genres to help students explore how race, gender, and sexuality intersect with language and inform textual experiences. From marriage licenses, passports, and don't ask, don't tell policies to literacy requirements and gag rules, written texts have played major roles in enforcing expectations about race and sex in the United States. At the same time, anti-slavery petitions, letters to the editor, wheat-pasted posters, and hashtag activism all also harness the power of writing to challenge and revise those expectations. In light of that active textual production and negotiation, this class traces public debates and daily experiences where people write or talk about race and sex in order to make a difference. Ultimately, the class takes on the power of words to break bones and heal wounds. Through reading and writing informed by scholarship in writing studies and rhetoric, students in this class will examine historical and contemporary interconnections among race, sexuality, gender, and texts in the United States, developing analytical tools for understanding how language works on and in their world.\nENGL 403 — Seminar on Tutoring Writing Across the Curriculum\n3 credits.\nExplores current theory and research on the writing process and analyzes disciplinary genres and conventions.

Examines the role of prescriptivism in linguistics from a disciplinary view (why are linguists against it when the public is so clearly interested in singling out some constructions as 'bad grammar'). Provides a historical view (the tradition of grammar writing -- who gets to decide what is 'correct') and a variationist view (corpus-based studies on phenomena like preposition stranding, split infinitives, the distinction of who/whom etc.) of grammar writing. Covers the historical and cultural roots of beliefs about what constitutes 'good' and 'bad' grammar. Introduces linguistic tools and methods to check claims about grammar.\nENGL 413 — English Words: Grammar, Culture, Mind\n3 credits.\nWords and rules of combination (grammar) are the two basic building blocks of language. Looks at English words from different linguistic perspectives: As objects of grammar, words follow certain rules of combination (you wouldn't say \"these dog ), but they also have internal structure. For example, a word like \"hopefulness is fine, while \"hopenessful\" does not exist. From a psycholinguistic perspective examine how children learn these formal properties as well as the meaning of words. Study how words are stored in the mind and what one can learn from situations in which one cannot access the mental dictionary properly (for example, when one feels a word is on \"the tip of one's tongue ). From a sociolinguistic perspective, look at historical and current influences on English vocabulary, including the role of dictionaries and spelling as a source of standardization. Does not require previous knowledge of linguistics.\nENGL 414 — Global Spread of English\n3 credits.\nExamination of the linguistic, social, and political impact of the spread of English around the world.

Includes perspectives from African American, American Indian, Asian American, and Chican@ and Latin@ studies.\nCHICLA/​HISTORY 151 — The North American West to 1850\n3-4 credits.\nExplores the history of places that have been called the American West before 1850. We start with Indigenous occupation; continue with European invasion and the creation of two new nations, Mexico and the U.S.; and end with U.S. conquest. We watch Indian lands becoming the object of Spanish, French, and English empires, and then see European incursions giving way to the hopes of new nation-states and newly empowered Indian peoples like Lakotas and Comanches. After studying the trails and trades that brought newcomers west, we reach key converging events: U.S. seizure of the Mexican North, resolution of the Oregon boundary dispute, discovery of western gold, West Coast arrival of Chinese immigrants, and Mormon exodus to the Great Basin. We use economic, environmental, political, cultural, and social analyses, and we attend to the dreams of many westerners: of North American, Latin American, European, African, and Asian origin or descent, and of all genders and class statuses.\nCHICLA/​HISTORY 152 — The U.S. West Since 1850\n3-4 credits.\nThis course explores the history of places that have been called the American West since 1850. We start with incorporation, as the U.S. surveyed a West that had become American in name and tried to make it American in fact, a process that westerners resisted as often as they welcomed it. By the late 19th century, the West was an identifiable region with characteristic economic features, race relations, and federal ties, and it held a unique place in collective memory. In the 20th century, western distinctiveness faded in some ways and persisted in others, and western variants unfolded of the world wars, Depression, Cold War, and Vietnam War; civil rights; suburbanization and the New Right; environmentalism; immigration; and globalization. We employ economic, environmental, political, cultural, and social analyses, and attend to the dreams of many westerners: people of North American, Latin American, European, African, and Asian descent, and of all genders, classes, and sexualities.\nCHICLA/​HISTORY 153 — Latina/Latino/Latinx History\n3-4 credits.\nExamines the historical, social, and legal experiences of Latinas/Latinos/Latinxs in the US since the mid-1800s with emphasis on Mexican migrations.

Considers the various meanings of the word \"border\" or \"frontera\". What is a border geographically speaking? What does it mean in political and legal terms? How do we conceive the border in cultural, literary, linguistic, political, judicial, and personal ways? What is like to live on the border or on the margins? It is said that the border is a contact zone, a meeting point, a way to transfer and share information, an invitation to (in)tolerance and ex/inclusion.

    "text": "ART HIST 102 — Seeing Through Conspiracy Theories\n3 credits.\nFake news is not a new problem. In taking on this ongoing issue, we begin before living memory (to avoid the deadening effect of feedback loops within today's media world), with a focus on the visual and built environment. How do conspiracy theories work? Do they fall into patterns? How can we recognize them? If they are empowering, how should we think about that? Visual material plays a special role in the reinforcement of conspiracy theories. Case studies around the world, from the Egyptian pyramids to the birth of \"modern\" art in the twentieth century, center on ways in which an evidence-based account of the making of an artwork or architectural site has been replaced by a (usually more interesting) story about its true, hidden nature. This story usually purports to reveal the \"conspiracy\" of an empowered institution or group to keep the truth away from average people. Of course, the reality is often much simpler and the dynamics of power more complex.\nART HIST 103 — Topics in Art History\n3-4 credits.\nOffers an introduction to world art by taking a thematic approach. Topics will center around art and architecture produced in a variety of media, from a wide time span, and a range of cultural and geographic points of origin.\nART HIST 104 — The Art of Diversity: Race and Representation in the Art and Visual Culture of the United States\n3-4 credits.\nThe history of art and visual culture in the United States from the period of colonization until the present from the perspective of how that imagery produced ideas of race and operated to define, exclude, and include various groups over time. Three basic aims: 1. To introduce art history of the United States from c. 1600-2018; 2.To provide skills in visual analysis and critical thinking; and 3. To encourage the understanding of ethnic and cultural minorities in the United States with an emphasis on the visual arts related to marginalization or minority status in the twentieth-and twenty-first century.\nART HIST 105 — Introductory Topics in Art History\n3 credits.\nIntroductory topics in Art History.\nART HIST 106 — Have Brush, Will Travel: The Italian Renaissance from Florence to Rome\n3 credits.\nExamines artistic developments that took place in Florence in the 15th century, and how the Florentine Renaissance paved the way to the achievements by painters, sculptors, and architects in Rome in the 16th century, many of whom traveled from Florence to Rome in pursuit of economic opportunity. Introduces the numerous important artistic works produced in Florence, Rome, and other artistic centers, and provides a basic understanding of the purposes, methodology, and terminology of art historical study.\nART HIST 107 — The Body, Sex, & Health in Art\n3 credits.\nConsiders the many fascinating ways in which cultures represented ideas of health, sex, disease, medicine, and death, focusing on the ways different art forms (painting, sculpture, architecture, prints, photography, textiles, decorative arts, hair, costume, music and dance, food) conveyed historically and culturally distinctive ideas about bodies. Linking the topics will be an attention to how notions of race, gender, and disability determine representations of the body. Enjoy an introduction to basic skills in visual interpretation that are widely applicable in today's world, while covering health and body-related topics chosen from the arts of Europe, China, Japan, Africa, the Islamic World, and the United States. Our objects of study range from ancient Greece and Rome to the present, with an emphasis on nineteenth- to twenty-first century art.\nART HIST 130 — Seeing Race: Anti-Racism and Visual Culture\n3 credits.\nConfronting how images work to shape ways of seeing race, this introduction to visual cultures tracks how power works through the visual - from visual surveillance and racial profiling to anti-racist visual activism. Trains critical understanding of the role of imaging in producing ways of seeing race in its intersections with gender, sexuality, and ability. Through critical consideration of the spectacle of racialized violence and the everyday micro-aggressions of the stereotype, addresses the ways that images harm. Also considers how just representation may offer restitution and repair. Explores forms of anti-racist visual activism that seize the power to look back. And questions the ethics of an assumed right to look and to take an image. In asking these imperative ethical and political questions about what images do, trains the critical capacity to harness and intervene in the powers of imaging.\nART HIST 201 — History of Western Art I: From Pyramids to Cathedrals\n4 credits.\nExamines the arts and cultures of Europe and the Mediterranean basin before the Renaissance. Explores canonical works such as the pyramids at Giza, the Parthenon in Athens, the Venus di Milo, Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the Book of Kells, the Great Mosque at Córdoba, Chartres cathedral, and Giotto's Arena Chapel. Define art broadly, to encompass the material culture of everyday life, including jewelry, ceramics, and textiles. Considers the social and historical contexts of art and artistic production - art and imperialism, ethnicity, technology, religious ritual and belief, and myth and storytelling, and its relationships to basic human concerns: death and the afterlife, desire and the body, self-definition and portraiture, power and propaganda, monstrosity and the supernatural, the divine and the sacred.

Learn how works of art were valued from the moment of their making, fought over by different nations, bought, sold, stolen, or ignored for centuries and revived only recently for study through the political, historical, social and cultural contexts of their making. Critically examine the concept of artistic genius; the influence of colonialism and imperialism on artistic production and consumption; the role of the patron and the art market in art's production and circulation; the relationship of fine art and popular culture; and the idea of globalization as it relates to \"western\" artistic traditions. Develop skills in visual analysis to understand artistic production.\nART HIST 203 — Survey of Asian Art\n3-4 credits.\nIntroduction to the artistic traditions of China and Japan from neolithic times to the nineteenth century and the Buddhist art of India with its subsequent East Asia embodiments.\nART HIST 205 — Global Arts\n3-4 credits.\nART IS GLOBAL (and always has been). Today, we find Egyptian protest artists inspiring activists around the globe via the internet, but in earlier times, Roman glass and Buddhist icons moved along the ancient Silk Route, networks of exchange flourished in the medieval Mediterranean region, and colonial empires brought visual cultures into volatile contact. Learn how to analyze images and objects produced through such exchanges that occurred around the world from ancient times through the contemporary. Develop skills needed to live fully in a world in which borders are no barriers to the movement of images, objects, and ideas and to deepen understanding of cultural differences and interactions. By exploring works in a range of media and tracing processes of cross-cultural exchange, develop sensitivity to visual and material form and a solid foundation in the practice of visual and material analysis.\nART HIST 206 — Survey of Photography: 1839 to 1989\n3-4 credits.\nSurvey of 150 years of photography's processes, practitioners, and genres.

Learn to appreciate the interaction between culture, history, and architectural form across time and space.\nART HIST 227 — The Ends of Modernism\n4 credits.\nConsiders the end of Modernist art as it gives way to what is called, problematically, contemporary art. While the term modern may generally mean what is vanguard or current, Modernism indicates a period of art (and the humanities) ranging from, arguably, 1880-1950. By considering its end, one can study four pivotal aspects of the movement: its origins, themes, and afterlives, as well as the art and histories that challenge its coherence. Modernism emerges as a heterogeneous set of images and attendant discourses which, negatively or positively, continue to work within the contemporary artistic and cultural moment.\nART HIST/​ENVIR ST/​GEOG/​HISTORY/​LAND ARC 239 — Making the American Landscape\n3-4 credits.\nTraces the history and evolution of the American cultural landscape from precolonial times to present.

The history of geography is particularly violent and exclusive. It is well known that systems of colonialist exploitation, theft, kidnapping, and murder were facilitated in part by the work of modern cartographers and \"explorers.\" The discipline that we have today is a product of these earlier colonial epistemologies and ideologies. The science that emerged from these fields - geography - institutionalizes and reproduces many the ideas and viewpoints of their modern practitioners.

If that question had been posed fifteen years ago, it would likely have been dismissed as unrealistic, undesirable, or just plain crazy. In recent years, however, the idea of introducing a universal basic income [UBI] has gained a lot of traction around the world. Growing inequalities, financial crises, fears about jobs being automated, and the COVID-19 pandemic have all helped to put UBI on the political map. But where did the idea come from? How is it traveling to different parts of the world? And on what grounds do different advocates justify their claims?

By the late 19th century, the West was an identifiable region with characteristic economic features, race relations, and federal ties, and it held a unique place in collective memory. In the 20th century, western distinctiveness faded in some ways and persisted in others, and western variants unfolded of the world wars, Depression, Cold War, and Vietnam War; civil rights; suburbanization and the New Right; environmentalism; immigration; and globalization.

We will develop and hone these tools through thinking about Latin American cases, paying specific attention to revolutions, social movements, and riots. The course is designed in three parts. It begins by exposing students to the dominant theoretical paradigms in the study of contentious politics as well as some prominent critiques. The course then turns to empirical themes in Latin American revolutions, challenging students to use and question the theoretical tools to which they have already been exposed. The final part of the course looks to social movements in Latin America. Cases will focus on challenges to dictatorships, identity-based movements, and resistance to globalization.\nINTL ST/​POLI SCI 327 — Indian Politics in Comparative Perspective\n3 credits.\nThis course explores the socio-economic and political outcomes across India. This course will employ the major theories of comparative politics that explain political outcomes such as regime type, economic development and conflict. This course explores why some countries are democracies, while others are dictatorships; why some countries are poor, while others are rich; and why some countries experience high levels of violence, while others are peaceful. The course considers how India comports with standard theories in comparative politics and how standard theories might be revised in light of the Indian case. The course maps variation on the sub-national and regional level. The course will ultimately consider reforms proposed by the Indian state to further democratic and economic development and to reduce conflict. Students will learn about India's politics in a structured manner, and will gain an appreciation of the power and limitations of the political science method.\nINTL ST/​HISTORY 330 — Global History of Humanitarianism\n3-4 credits.\nWhat motivates us to try to alleviate the suffering of people in distant parts of the world? Examines the origins of humanitarian ideas and institutions, and how various humanitarian campaigns have been shaped by geopolitical processes, including the abolition of the slave trade, the spread of missionary Christianity, European imperialism, the Cold War, neoliberalism and the emergence of new media forms. Questions include: who has benefited from various humanitarian aid campaigns throughout history? How have various humanitarian campaigns shaped, and been shaped by, patterns of global inequality? Why have some populations, and not others, been deemed worthy of the world's compassion? Explores the worlds, perspectives and visions of humanitarians through a range of primary sources, including diary entries, political propaganda, memoirs, journalistic reportage, photography and documentary film.\nINTL ST/​HISTORY 332 — East Asia & The U.S. Since 1899\n3-4 credits.\nFrom the Boxer Rebellion, to the dropping of the atomic bombs, to the nuclear stand-off with North Korea, American foreign relations with East Asia during the 20th century were as consequential as they were controversial. Survey the issues and questions that alternately made allies and enemies of these nations: How did the quest for markets influence American policy towards China? How did European imperialism shape Japan's rise? Why did communism seem to offer a more compelling economic and political arrangement to China and North Korea? While squarely rooted in East Asia this course will also explore the questions that united and divided Americans over their nation's foreign policy. Through examining these questions, develop answers and construct their own narrative of the relationship between the United States and East Asia.\nINTL ST/​ED POL 335 — Globalization and Education\n3 credits.\nDiscuss the ways education is inextricably linked to global political, economic, and social contexts.

Exploration of its conduct on five continents entails both a diversity of sources (film, fiction, documents, and memoir) and a range of topics (geopolitics, ideology, internationalism, empire, revolution, counterinsurgency, and covert operations). Its half-century history was marked by nuclear-armed stalemate and ideological competition in Europe, cultural politics of repression and generational revolt in America, interplay of anti-colonial nationalism and counterinsurgency in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and a succession of major wars worldwide in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, and Afghanistan.

This new wealth of information creates exciting opportunities for more targeted, individualized approaches to health care and better management of public health risks such as age-related diseases or pandemics. However, it also creates policy challenges such as privacy, discrimination, equality, and fairness. Covers what types of health-relevant data exist, how such data is typically analyzed and used, and discuss what types of applications this enables, what type of policy challenges this brings about, and which options policy makers have to deal with these challenges.

What are its vectors and its limits? International relations theorists have defined soft power as \"the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion.\" This graduate seminar will put this notion to the test. We will investigate how elites, interest groups, religious bodies, and nation-states seek to exercise hegemony in the international order through non-violent means. How was \"soft power\" implemented on the ground in the 20th century- and how did its use transform international relations? To probe these questions, we will focus on a series of case studies in European and U.S. international history. Topics covered include the expansion of capitalism and consumer culture; the globalization of international legal instruments and human rights claims; and de-secularization, religious radicalism, and counter-insurgency. In the process of analyzing our case studies, we will refine our analytical vocabulary.
