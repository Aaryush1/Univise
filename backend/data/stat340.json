      "Name": "Data Science Modeling II",
      "Description": "Teaches how to apply statistical methods to learn from data. Topics include one- and two-sample inference; an introduction to Bayesian inference and associated probability theory; linear and logistic regression models; the bootstrap; and cross-validation. An integrated statistical computing environment is used to explore and analyze data, develop models, make inferences, and communicate results in a reproducible manner through a project-oriented approach to learning.",
